A shiny app for recording your musical instrument practice, then reviewing your progress over time.

Practice is boring! The motivation, to be able to play a piece or exercise or just to play better, feels very separated from the actual task of practicing. The purpose of this app is to try and bridge the gap, and help you see how every little success each day helps to achieve the ultimate goals of practicing. By logging the practice each day using a simple UI, the commitment is very low,  but over time the data reveals just how much improvement the player is making in each peice.

The data collection of this app is perhaps unexpected; the focus is on the subjective rather than the objective. The player is asked to give a "Percentage Mastered" for the piece, and are prompted with the most recent value in the log for that peice. This means that the players thinking is directed at answering the questions:
  
  1. How far away from mastering the piece am I? (negative)
  2. How far have I come in mastering the peice? (positive)
  3. How much have I progressed since last time? (positive)
 
The positive and negative questions allow the player to straightforwardly estimate their mastery of a piece or exercise. The reason for focussing on this, rather than more objective measures like "time practiced" or "tempo", is (1) it requires less set-up/measurement for the player, and (2) it gets more to the heart of experiencing and enjoying music: *How do you feel about your mastery of the piece?* If the answer is 100%, then as a player myself I'd say it is "job done!", regardless of how much time is spent practicing the peice or how fast you can play it.

The app is still very much in development; it currently only works to log practice rather than a good way to reflect on your progress, although there is some graphing capability. Plans for the future are:

  1. Prompts/explanation bubbles for directing users on how to properly use the tool. I particularly want to put an explanation for how a player can input 'Percentage mastered:', as this level of subjectivity may come as a bit of a shock!
  2. Prettying up the tool: Currently it has a very "default shiny", which is a bit soulless.
